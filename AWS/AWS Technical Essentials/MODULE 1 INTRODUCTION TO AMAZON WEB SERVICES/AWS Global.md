- Infrastructure, like data centers and networking connectivity, still exists as the foundation of every cloud application. 
- In AWS, this physical infrastructure makes up the AWS Global Infrastructure, in the form of Regions and Availability Zones.

# Regions
- geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers
- named after the location where they reside
	- e.g. in USA Region in Northern Virginia is called the Northern Virginia Region
- Each AWS Region is associated with a geographical name and a Region code.
	- e.g. - **us-east-1** is the first Region created in the eastern US area. The geographical name for this Region is N. Virginia.
