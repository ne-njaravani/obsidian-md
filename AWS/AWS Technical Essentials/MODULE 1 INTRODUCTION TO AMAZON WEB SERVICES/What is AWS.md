Each type provides different levels of control, flexibility & management

## On Premises

- B4 cloud, 
	- Companies hosted & maintained hardware equipment in their own data centres
	- They often allocated infrastructure departments to take care of these
	- Resulted in costly operations that made some workloads and experimentation impossible
- As internet use became more widespread
	- Demand for compute, storage & networking equipment increased
	- For some cost of maintaining large physical presence was unsustainable
		- Enter Cloud Computing

## Cloud
- The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pricing.
- Companies don't have to to manage & maintain their own hardware & data centres
- Companies like AWS maintain data centres & provide virtual data centre technologies & services to companies & users over the internet

## Hybrid
- Way to connect infrastructure & applications b/w cloud based resources & existing resources that aren't located in the cloud
- Most common method of this deployment between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure 
	- connects cloud resources to internal systems to extend and grow an organisation's infrastructure into the cloud.
