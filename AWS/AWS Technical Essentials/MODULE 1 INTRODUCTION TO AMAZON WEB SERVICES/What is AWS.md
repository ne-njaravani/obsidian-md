# Cloud Computing

- On demand delivery of IT resources
- Pay as you go
- Provides devs w/ ability to focus on what matters most by avoiding work like:
	- procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning

# Deployment Models

![[Pasted image 20251106125444.png]]

Each type provides different levels of control, flexibility & management

## On Premises

- B/4 cloud, 
	- Companies hosted & maintained hardware equipment in their own data centres
	- They often allocated infrastructure departments to take care of these
	- Resulted in costly operations that made some workloads and experimentation impossible
- As internet use became more widespread
	- Demand for compute, storage & networking equipment increased
	- For some cost of maintaining large physical presence was unsustainable
		- Enter Cloud Computing

## Cloud
- The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pricing.
- Companies don't have to to manage & maintain their own hardware & data centres
- Companies like AWS maintain data centres & provide virtual data centre technologies & services to companies & users over the internet

### Advantages
- PAYG
	- based on paying only for the resources that you use
- Benefits from massive economies of scale
	- can achieve a lower cost than you can get on your own
		- b/c usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud
	- AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices
- Stop guessing capacity
	- capacity decision before deploying an application
		- often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity
	- can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice
- Increase speed & agility
	- IT resources are only a click away
		- reduce the time to make resources available to developers from weeks to minutes
		- results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organisation
			- b/c cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower
- Realise cost savings
	- Instead of managing data centers, companies can use cloud computing to focus on what makes their business unique and better serve their customers.
- Go global in minutes
	- Apps can be deployed in multiple regions around the world w/ a few clicks
	- can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.

## Hybrid
- Way to connect infrastructure & applications b/w cloud based resources & existing resources that aren't located in the cloud
- Most common method of this deployment between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure 
	- connects cloud resources to internal systems to extend and grow an organisation's infrastructure into the cloud.

## On-premises vs Cloud
![[Pasted image 20251106131739.png]]
- Scenario
	- developers must deploy a new application feature
	- Before they deploy, the team wants to test the feature in a separate QA environment that has the same configurations as production
	- on-premises 
		- an additional environment requires you to buy and install hardware, connect the necessary cabling, provision power, install operating systems, and more...
			- time consuming and expensive
			- new feature’s time-to-market increases while the developers wait for the QA environment.
	- cloud
		- replicate an entire production environment in a matter of minutes or even seconds
		- Instead of physically installing hardware and connecting cabling, the solution is managed over the internet
